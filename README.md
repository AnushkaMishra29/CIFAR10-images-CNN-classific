# CIFAR10-images-CNN-classific
A CNN classification on the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research dataset of classes namely 'airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship',  and 'truck'. The dataset consists of 50,000 images. Out of which we split our training set and test set respectively to train the model. We then predict the classes based on our test images and find out the respective probabilities of the classes.
